This is a simple, clean HTML Style Guide built with HTML and SCSS.

Itâ€™s based on an Affinity Photo mockup I designed, and is included as a design file. The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s also mobile responsive.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
